## Targeted Platforms

| Platform      | Supported | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| iOS           | ‚úÖ        | Will be the first and only targeted platform at the beginning                                                                                                                                     |
| Android       | üïí        | Will come once iOS version is good enough                                                                                                                                                         |
| Desktop Web   | üïí        | Would be nice to have but I'd rather focus on mobile versions                                                                                                                                     |
| Windows Phone | ‚ùå        | React Native's Documentation is mostly focused on Android and iOS, Windows Phone has been [discontinued](https://www.cnet.com/news/windows-10-mobile-features-hardware-death-sentence-microsoft/) |

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) in August 2018.

#### Add new words

In order to add new pairs of english-french words, follow these steps:

- Edit the Google Spreadsheet (note: not public yet)
- Download it as `.csv`
- Execute `update_words.sh` script by running `./scripts/update_words.sh <digit>` from the root of the repository (replace `<digit>` with the number of letters e.g. if you want to generate the 2-letter words, run `./scripts/update_words.sh 2`)

## Documentation

### Internal Documentation

:book: This [gist](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) displays a list of emoji that can be used on GitHub.

- Please don't use emoji in titles though, as they would be part of the URL otherwise.

### External Documentation

#### React Native: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/

**Note:** the latest documentation that has been read by `sebranly` is from version 0.56 as it was the most recent stable version (as of August 2018): the prefix for the URL is always `https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.56/` (e.g. https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.56/getting-started.html is the starting point)

| Part             | Chapter                                                                                                            | Date `sebranly` read it for the last time |

:question: Why is there such a table here?

> Documentation is a really important part of any project. Thanks to this table I can keep track of what I read and more importantly when I read it. Also, it's publicly available so that people can let me know if I missed an update that includes drastic changes (e.g. the documentation page about Performance changed so much that I should take a look at it again).

## To Do List

| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Make the words' spreadsheet public | Do it after a while, once the project is good enough |
