## Git workflow :cop:

### Commits

Commit messages should be semantic thanks to this [rigid format](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages), i.e. they should start with one of these values:
`['chore:', 'docs:', 'feat:', 'fix:', 'refactor:', 'style:', 'test:']`

The next part should be an action, starting with a verb in present tense.
Complete example: `docs: update readme`

## License :copyright:

This repository does not contain any license for now (i.e. there is no `LICENSE.md`). It means that, **for now**, this project does **not** accept contributions.
For more information about it, please read the following [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/#choosing-the-right-license) stating:
> You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work.

The same link also mentions:
> If you're creating an open source project, we strongly encourage you to include an open source license.

Having a license in order to encourage contributions is definitely part of my future plans for this repository. I will probably choose [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) when doing so (this is subject to change).

:question: Why not having a license directly at the beginning of the project?
> There are two reasons behind this personal decision:
> - I'm learning React Native from scratch (although I know React) at the moment and would like to play around with it by myself by writing some code
> - I think that expecting contributions at this point is too early anyway, I would like to have a solid base (i.e. a proof of concept or a beta version) before people can contribute to the code

## Documentation :book:

### Internal Documentation

This [gist](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) displays a list of emoji that can be used on GitHub.

### External Documentation

**Note:** the latest documentation that has been read by `sebranly` is from version 0.56 as it was the most recent stable version (as of August 2018): the prefix for the URL is always `https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.56/` (e.g. https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.56/getting-started.html is the starting point)

:question: Why is there such a table here?
> Documentation is a really important part of any project. Thanks to this table I can keep track of what I read and more importantly when I read it. Also, it's publicly available so that people can let me know if I missed an update that includes drastic changes (e.g. the documentation page about Performance changed so much that I should take a look at it again).
